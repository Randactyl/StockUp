Always keep your inventory stocked with your most used items!

Whether it's siege weapons, repair kits, potions, soul gems, or whatever, Stock Up can automatically buy whatever you need when you open a store.

Stocking an item works much the same way as splitting a stack of items. Right click an item and choose "Stock Item" from the context menu. Then, a dialog will pop up where you can enter the amount you want to always have on hand (up to 100).

In the settings menu, you can check an option to prefer buying items with your alliance points (when available) and see which items you are currently stocking.

This is my take on the request from this thread (http://www.esoui.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2123). If this addon proves too hefty for your needs, check out CyroSiege by Ayantir.
